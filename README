Welcome to TwIntro, a simple intro to Twilio that sends text messages to a specified phone number.

dotenv-example is provided as an example; rename it to .env and replace the placeholders with actual API keys and a source phone number.

Tips for getting started:
Put your credentials and phone number in .env (see dotenv-example)
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
bundle install
rails server
